					Unfortunately a close family friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer last year. In May I'll be running a marathon in support of all the work they're doing at Pancreatic Cancer UK.</br>
					</br>
					Shouts to ma boy Big D.</br>
					</br>
					I'll also be trying to beat my dad's time (3:17) from back when he was a young 'un, which is going to be hard. Very hard.</br>
					</br>
					Any donations are hugely appreciated (and as a JG employee, they'll match my donation if it gets over Â£500!).</br>
